## My Story

My name is Rocky Yang, a web developer with experience in Python, JavaScript, React.js, SQL, HTML, and CSS.  My interest in web developing goes all the way back when I first started playing video games.  My interest in learning how to develop video games grew and eventually I developed a passion and liking for web developing.  I love to problem solve, which is why coding became fun for me.  I'm looking for an environment that is welcoming and comes with opportunites to continue learning.
