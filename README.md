## Introduction

Hello, my name is Rocky Yang.  I am a beginner Software Developer residing in Saint Paul, Minnesota.  I have always wanted to become an engineer, however due to unfortunate circumstances, I was forced to put my goals on hold.  Fast forward to 2020, I have finally taken my first step into the world of Software Development.  I am currently enrolled into App Academy and striving to achieve my goals in the world of technology!
